    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service govern your use of KMAGENCY’s website and services. 
      By contacting us, booking a call or working with us, you agree to these terms.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No guarantee of specific results</h2>
    <p>
      We do not guarantee specific income levels or results. 
      Performance depends on many factors including your content, effort, brand, audience and platform rules.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Professional relationship</h2>
    <p>
      We act as a management and consulting partner. 
      All agreements and revenue splits are discussed and confirmed separately in writing (for example via contract or signed proposal).
    </p>

    <h2>4. Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for complying with the terms and guidelines of platforms you use (e.g. OnlyFans, Instagram, TikTok).
      We do not advise you to break platform rules or local laws.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      You retain ownership of your content and brand. 
      We may use anonymized metrics or blurred screenshots for private reporting and case studies, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, KMAGENCY is not liable for indirect, incidental or consequential damages 
      arising from the use of our website or services.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to these terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. 
      Continued use of our site or services after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
