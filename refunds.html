    <h1>Chargeback & Refund Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Services, not digital products</h2>
    <p>
      KMAGENCY provides management and consulting services, not one-time digital downloads. 
      Our work includes time, strategy, operations and ongoing support.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Fees and payments</h2>
    <p>
      Payment terms (retainers, revenue share, setup fees) are agreed case-by-case in a separate written agreement or proposal.
      That document will control how and when payments are made.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      Because our work is based on time and custom strategy, refunds are generally not offered for completed periods of service. 
      If you believe there has been an error in billing, contact us so we can review it.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>
      Unauthorized chargebacks harm both sides. 
      If there is an issue, we ask that you contact us first so we can attempt to resolve it directly 
      before involving your bank or payment provider.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cancelling ongoing work</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to stop working together, we simply end the agreement for future periods as described in your contract 
      (for example, end of the current month). Services already delivered are still payable.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Questions</h2>
    <p>
      For any questions about payments, refunds or chargebacks, please reach out via the Contact page.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:12px;opacity:.7;margin-top:25px;">
      This page is a general policy summary and does not replace your signed individual agreement. 
      Always refer to your specific contract for final terms.
